# Modules

So how does code & workspace organization work?

nested modules are a very useful organizing principle.

what about functors?
yeah I feel like I don't want to spend my complexity budget there.

ok and how to names work?
what if I still double-down on git + the file system ðŸ¤”
so names are symlinks.

I mean I don't love file watchers.
but git is super cool.
how do commits work?
and branches?
yeah so some of the things don't super make sense.

Ok what if we don't have the files reified on your file system? they just live in git's belly?
