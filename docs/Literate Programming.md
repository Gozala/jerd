# Literate Programming

I kindof want a builtin notebook setup, like jupyter and stuff.
Also inter-linking between notebooks.

Code should live in projects. So you can have a project you're working on, and then when you're done with it, you can delete all the code associated with that project.


Also, what if there was a remote server for collaborating?
and then the notebooks data format was CRDT-backed, for realtime editing?

so you can save different notebooks?
where are they saved to?
they are also associated with projects.

so a repo
has

/data (terms, types, effects)
/docs -> generated documentation
  - html & javascript I guess
/notebooks
  - Names.jdnb

Manifest.yaml
- all the dependencies, with their hashes

Readme.md
- autogenerated! why not folks.
- the AST of the docs needs to be writable to markdown as well as html
- so you have the docs, but then also include a list of contributors n stuff


/terms -> the data (or just call it /data)
/types
