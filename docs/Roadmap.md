- [x] base types (string, int)
- [x] functions
- [x] binops
- [x] validate basic effects setup (CPS etc)
- [x] basic generics!
- [x] if
- [x] simple-let. gotta have it
- [x] type variables in type declarations
- [ ] effect handler return value fix
- [ ] verify that nested effects work
- [ ] effect variables, cmon
- [ ] records
  - [ ] basic
  - [ ] generic
  - [ ] row polymorphic
- [ ] enums
  - [ ] basic
  - [ ] generic
  - [ ] row polymorphic
- [ ] match
- [ ] let & function arg destructuring of records
- [ ] tuples please
- [ ] array types, literals, indexers
  - what do I think about "index out of range"? Should I allow "panics"?
  - or should I be perfectly safe ðŸ¤”
  - I guess it could be a "pseudo-effect" as well, like "ffi".
  - or it could be the same as "ffi"? naw, might as well distinguish.
  - so yeah, have a builtin `panic` effect, and the unchecked versions of array and map access use it.
    - or should I use something other than effects? like it might be weird/confusing to have these "special" effects that don't trigger CPS, but aren't pure. ah lets have them be combined, at least for now. like my goodness.
- [ ] type classes (inferred-ish? dunno how to dance that)
- [ ] affine types prolly, once type classes are a thing

- [ ] type inference!
- [ ] effects inference!
