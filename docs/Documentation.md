# Documentation

How do we do documentation?

Do I allow embedding of *values* into docs? Such that rendering docs requires running code?
I mean if it's pure, it's ok, right?
a little weird though.

so markdown is very nice.
but having real data types is nicer.
should they be ffi types?

Oh and we want to be able to associate metadata with terms, for example documentation.

- look at unison's format
- look at ocaml's format
- look at what elm's doing
- look at go too
