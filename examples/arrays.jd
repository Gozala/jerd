// um

const x = []
const y = [1, 2]
const z = ["hi", "ho"]

const a = [...z, "Yes"]
const b = ["Good", ...z, "uhuh"]

// need to be able to indexing to get stuff out
// also maybe slices can be nices
// and indexing means we need the Option type, right?
// andddd so do I need to allow NamedTuples? e.g. records but no names?
// because like `Some(x)` is a lot nicer than `Some{contents: x}`.
